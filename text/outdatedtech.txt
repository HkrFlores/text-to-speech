What is a severely out-of-date technology you're still forced to use regularly?

At work we still use a dot matrix printer with the strips you have to tear off.
We've been told that when it breaks next time that's it. So we are all waiting on it to die.

Does it go "“SKKEEEEEEEER SKEEEEEEEEER SKEEEEEEEEEER" every time it prints? I gotta admit,
I have a lot of nostalgia associated with that sound.

“It fell down the stairs by accident”

Have you by chance seen the movie Office Space? Just a question...

Ha, I used to operate a machine commissioned in '02 that came brand new with one of these.
Maintenance manager would print error logs nightly off it, took like an hour.
Also it had display terminals that had one and only one color, provided by the color of phosphor used.

The system itself was originally designed by the company Is like 1991, industrial tech is often a case of "this way still works and we can still source the parts from somewhere so why change it?”

Wow! Are you still finding replacement ribbon cartridges, or are you re-inking your old ones?
