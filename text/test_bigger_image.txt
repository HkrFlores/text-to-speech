Non-Americans of Reddit, what state would you want to visit the most?

I always wanted to see the Grand Canyon, so I guess Arizona

The Grand Canyon was just breath taking, I wish I could have spent more time there. 
Arizona in general is pretty nice - if you like the heat! It is so much different then here in New England.

The main overlook can be overrun with people. Drive east on the main road (hwy64 I think) and you'll find lots of spectacular overlooks with way less people.
The road goes on for like 30 miles. Plus so many hiking trails.

If you do go, thereâ€™s a restaurant in Williams, AZ called the Pine Country Inn that has awesome pie.
