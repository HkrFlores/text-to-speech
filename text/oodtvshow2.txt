What TV show managed to be consistently fantastic from the first episode
to the finale?

Band of Brothers

Cpt sobel. We salute the rank not the man.

Perfection. For some reason I never got around to watching The Pacific but I just started on that
‘one this week.

Iscrolled down all the comments and this Is the only show that comes close to being awesome
from start to finish. A lot of good shows were listed but most had some shitty episodes or ran too
long after losing the story.

damn someone mentioned it, now it’s rewatch time

100%. In my opinion Band of Brothers Is the best tv ever made.
